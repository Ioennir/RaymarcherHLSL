# RaymarcherHLSL
Raymarcher done in HLSL.

Note: the material implementation needs a fix to lerp between objects with different materials, I will upload it as soon as I have time to fix it :)
I wanted to implement a raymarcher using C# SharpDX and HLSL to execute it from my desktop, so I did some research about it, hoping to find some implementations to get some insight into it, but found none. (There are plenty of them in Shadertoy, GLSL, though, and some really nice tutorials out there)

Thing is, I uploaded this here so if someone like me searchs they find something to investigate :)

This is the result of my sdf scene rendering normal values:
